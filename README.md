# RaycastedMetaballs

C++/OpenGL implementation based on [GPU‚Äêbased Fast Ray Casting for a Large Number of Metaballs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220507233_GPU-based_Fast_Ray_Casting_for_a_Large_Number_of_Metaballs) by Kanamori et al. (2008)

## Overview

A simple particle system was implemented, defining the maximum number of particles and their maximum life time.
Particles are simulated on CPU.
For each particle a billboard (i.e. a plane that always faces the camera) is generated in the geometry shader.
In the fragment shader, the implicit surface of the meta balls are calculated for each fragment of the billboards.

A ray is traced from the camera in direction of the fragment.
The intersection of the ray and the implicit surface is calculated iteratively.
If no intersection is found, the fragment is discarded.
For the sake of efficiency, the intersection with the implicit surface is first calculated roughly and with big steps.
In case an intersection is found, a more accurate position is calculated with binary search.
For lighting, the normals of the isosurface are calculated by evaluating the density field gradients.

## Dependencies

## Controls

If you're familiar with shooter controls, you're also familiar with the controls of this project :)

w - move forward    
a - strafe left    
s - move backward    
d - strafe right    
space - move upward    
ctrl - move downward    

1 - Enable point shader    
2 - Enable billboard shader    
3 - Enable meta ball shader    

y - freeze particle simulation    
x - enable slow motion / continue particle simulation if frozen    
c - disable slow motion / continue particle simulation if frozen    
escape - close application
